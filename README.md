# Growth-Strategy Project
Contains results of an analysis of growth strategy at One Acre Fund and proposed improvements to strategy.

## Summary: 
This repository shares an analysis I performed that showed that the model used to identify areas with high potential for increasing new client acquisition was not effective.  It lead to a follow-up project where I worked with other analysts at the company to improve the model.

## Demonstrated Skillset(s):
Statistical Inference:
1. Designing a regression analysis
2. Vetting model fit.
3. Interpretting results in business context.
4. Proposing viable improvements.

Programming Skillset:
1. Python for statisical analysis (
2. Puthon for data visualization
3. Jupyter Notebooks for generating high-quality summaries of results.

## Contents of Repository:
1. Analysis Plan: Detailed explanantion of the method of analysis and why it was chosen.
2. Analysis Script: Python script that replicates the regression analysis.
3. Analysis Results: HTML file summarizing the analysis findings. (Post-departure)
4. Proposal of Site Selection Method:  Document submitted to country program leadership to get approval to try a new method for identifying high potential growth areas.

## Context:

Microfinance Program: The company offers quaity seed and fertlizer on loan to smallscale farmers across East Africa. Farmers are enrolled into the program by local loan officers.  Loan officers are usually constrained to recruiting farmers from a 3-5 km radius around their own farm. They enroll farmers by through social networks from their community.  As a data analyst I was attached to the Operations team for the Kenya country program. That team was responsible for enrolling farmers, collecting repayment. The country program operates on a yearly cycle that matches with the major planting season in Westerrn Kenya where the program originally started.  Each year the Operations team  identifies the locations to expand into order to reach the revenue goal. 

Research Question: Analyze the method used for selecting the expansion areas in the previous season and determine whether the method was effective at predicting the enrollment performance of the new sites.
