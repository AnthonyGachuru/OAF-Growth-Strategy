# OAF Growth Strategy Project

## Summary: 
This repository contains results of an analysis of growth strategy at One Acre Fund and proposed improvements to that strategy. The results of that analysis lead to the development of a predictive model to identify high-potential growth areas. That model was proven to be an improvement over the previous method of identifying growth areas.

## Demonstrated Skillset(s):
Statistical Inference:
1. Designing and executing a regression analysis.
2. Interpreting results in a business context.
3. Proposing actionable recommendations.

## Programming Skillset:
1. Python for statistical analysis (Pandas, Numpy, Statsmodels)
2. Python for data visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
3. Jupyter Notebooks for generating high-quality and reproducible reports.

## Contents of Repository:
1. One Acre Fund Growth Strategy Analysis.py (and .ipynb): Python script and Jupyter notebook that replicates the regression analysis (Post-departure: Based on an R script I wrote at the time). 
2. One Acre Fund Growth Strategy Analysis.html: HTML file summarizing the results of the study of the old expansion strategy (Post-departure: Based on a report submitted at the time).
3. Inward Growth Site Selection Proposal.pdf:  Document submitted to country program leadership to get approval to try a new method for identifying high potential growth areas. (Original Document).

## Context:
Microfinance Program: The company offers quality seed and fertilizer on loan to smallscale farmers across East Africa. Farmers are enrolled in the program by local loan officers.  Loan officers are usually constrained to recruiting farmers from a 3-5 km radius around their farm. They enroll farmers through social networks from their community.  As a data analyst, I was attached to the Operations team for the Kenya country program. That team was responsible for enrolling farmers and collecting repayment. The country program operates on a yearly cycle that matches the primary planting season in western Kenya, where the program initially started.  Each year the Operations team identifies the locations to expand into order to reach the growth goal for the next year.

Research Question: Analyze the method used for selecting the expansion areas in the previous season and determine whether the method was effective at predicting the enrollment performance of the new sites.
